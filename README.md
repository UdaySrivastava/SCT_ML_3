# SCT_ML_3
## Problem Statement : Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

### Description :
This project involved classifying images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The objective was to develop a straightforward yet effective image classification model by preprocessing the dataset for consistency and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It highlights the application of classical machine learning techniques in image classification.
